# Virtual Keyboard Using OpenCV

## 

This project implements a virtual keyboard using OpenCV, allowing users to type on their computer without a physical keyboard. The virtual keyboard can detect hand gestures or mouse movements to simulate key presses.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition for typing
- Customizable keyboard layout
- Real-time feedback on key presses
- Supports multiple languages
- Lightweight and efficient

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Mediapipe (for hand tracking)
- Optional: Pygame (for enhanced GUI)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vamshi36819/virtual-keyboard.git
   cd virtual-keyboard
